**Project Description**

The intention behind this project is to create an interactive webpage that users can modify through creating their own public profiles with a name, description and profile image, adding and removing photos, and liking photos shared by other users.

**Techniques and Technology**

This project is meant to showcase a culmination of my understanding of HTML and CSS coding, combining skills like flex containers, grids, and responsive design principles to create a webpage with a variety of subtle tricks that transitions seamlessly between desktop and mobile version layouts.

**Images**
